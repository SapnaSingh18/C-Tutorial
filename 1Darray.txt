                                       In C++,
                                             a one-dimensional array is a collection of elements of the same data type arranged 
                                        in a linear sequence. Each element in the array can be accessed using its index (position).

                               The index starts from 0 for the first element and goes up to the array size minus one for the last element.

                                 Here's a full example of declaring, initializing, and accessing elements in a one-dimensional array :

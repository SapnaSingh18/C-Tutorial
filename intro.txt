                                   C++ is an object oriented programming language . It is an extension of c programming .

                                 It allow you to define class and object to model real world entities and their behaviour .
        

                         It follows OOPs concept (Object Oriented Programming Structure). Everythings in c++ is associated 
                                          with class and object , along with its attributes and methods .

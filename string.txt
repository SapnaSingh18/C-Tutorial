                                                                                 String
                                                                             **************

                                   In C++, a string is a sequence of characters represented as a data type that is used to store and 
                  manipulate textual data. It is part of the Standard Template Library (STL) and is implemented as a class in the C++ standard library.

                             The C++ string class provides many built-in functions and operators that make it convenient to work with strings,
                      including concatenation, comparison, searching, and manipulation. The string class automatically handles memory management,
                           resizing, and other low-level details, making it easier and safer to work with compared to character arrays.


                                                  To use strings in C++, you need to include the <string> header:

                                                                         Source Code of String

                                                           #include <string>  // For string library

                                                 Here's an example of how to declare and initialize a string variable:
                                           ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
                                                                         #include <iostream>
                                                                         #include <string>

                                                                         int main()
                                                                            {
                                                                std::string myString = "Hello, world!";
                                                                std::cout << myString << std::endl;
                                                                           return 0;
                                                                               }


                                                                               Output :
                                                                            `````````````
                                                                           Hello, world!


                        You can perform various operations on strings, such as concatenation, finding substrings, getting the length, and more,
                                        using the member functions and operators provided by the std::string class.

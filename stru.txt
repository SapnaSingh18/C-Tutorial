                                              The structure is a user-defined data type that is available in C++.
                            Structures are used to combine different types of data types, just like an array is used to combine the same type of data types.
 
                                 A structure is declared by using the keyword “struct“. When we declare a variable of the structure we need to write
                                                the keyword “struct in C language but for C++ the keyword is not mandatory

                                                                            
                                                                            SYntax:

                                                                                };

                                A union is a type of structure that can be used where the amount of memory used is a key factor. 
                                      Similarly to the structure, the union can contain different types of data types.

                                Each time a new variable is initialized from the union it overwrites the previous in C language but
                                            in C++ we also don’t need this keyword and uses that memory location.
                                                        It is declared by using the keyword “union“.
